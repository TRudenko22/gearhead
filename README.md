# gearhead
___
## Program boilerplate generator written in bash

### Usage

I created gearhead to save me the trouble of having to create directories and files for a project.

gearhead will takes 2 arguments *TYPE* and *NAME*

This will create a project directory of the same name and populate it with the corresponding files.


### Current projects supported
`py-standard` - Creates a project with a modules directory and a main.py
`py-flask`    - Creates a project with a basic Flask application project structure
`go`          - Creates and initializes a go project with a main.go file
